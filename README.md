# Rock-Paper-Scissors
This is the third project from The Odin Project's web develpment foundations curriculum. Live version: https://jonro2955.github.io/odin_foundations_3_rock_paper_scissors/

The goal is to create a web page in html, css and javascript where the user can play rock, paper, scissors against the computer. The the first part of the project was creating a simple console version that is played by typing words on the browser dev tools command line, which is contained in rock_paper_scissors.html. The second part is using the HTML, CSS, JavaScript and DOM learned so far to create an interactive visual game webpage, which is contained in the the index.html and script.js files. 

The game works by clicking the rock, paper or scissors icons or pressing the r, p, or s keys on the keyboard to play a round against the computer. The computer will then make a random selection, generate a brief animation, then announce the results of the round along with a score update. Once one side has accumulated 5 points, the game announces a winner, loser or tie.  

What I learned:
- Using javascript to activate browser alerts, input prompts, and console logs.
- Using console.log(...) at key points in code to troubleshoot problems.
- DOM, page content and style manipulation using javascript.
- Using event objects and event listeners in the document or window.
- Algorithmic planning and proper function and variable naming to make readable code. 
- How to create simple animation using recursive setTimeout() function loops.
- Anonymous and inline functions, refactoring code to use function expressions to use features work such as removeEventListener(). 
- How to organize functions and variables with proper scope to achieve desired functionality.
