# Rock-Paper-Scissors

## [Live Site](https://jonro2955.github.io/odin_foundations_3_rock_paper_scissors/)

This is an interactive "rock, paper, scissors" game written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

The user starts the game by clicking a rock, paper or scissors, or by pressing the R, P or S keys on the keyboard. The computer will then make a random selection after a short animation. The winner will be evaluated by the program and the results will be announced with an animation. The first party to reach 5 points will be announced as the winner of the game. 

This app contains several special features to make the game a more interactive experience, including keyboard support using r, p, or s keys, visual animations and sound effects. 

My main focus in this project was making the code as neat, modular and organized as possible in one file. I also learned a lot about using good variable and function names.
